Hello, everyone! This is one of the weirdest sites: or your money back! We have ZIM, neopets, music, and much, much,
more. E-mail us for questions, comments, complaints and information. Why not click on the Very Weird Stuff link to see
more, or click on the music link? We have halloween and christmas pictures on the NeoPics link. Cheese is not a wild
thing!!!!!!!!! Now I have decided to go for a world record. I will try to make the longest web page ever, made
completely out of text! Won't that be fun? I will just type, and type, and never, ever use copy and paste. Wow...I
really must be bored. Just goes to show what boredom can do to you. Any way, that's it for now. Wait, no it isn't, I
still have to keep going, and going, and going. Because I do. THE REST OF THE STUFF I TYPE WILL BE COMPLETLY IN CAPS
JUST BECAUSE I CAN. THAT IS ALL. SEEYA! Hi, I'm back. So far this is nowhere near the world record. I think. I don't
exactly know where it is...oh, well. I'll just have to do the very best that I can. No one is really coming here,
anyway. So it doesn't matter. By the way, TAB is a worthwhile, community-service organization. The form link is to a
100% fake TAB registration form that you can fill out just for laughs. I can't believe I'm bothering to do this. I have
very low expectations of my site. None ever comes here, I could do this all day long and I still wouldn't have any more
hits.
